This place would be a hit in Seattle. They serve a great tasting, freshly roasted coffee and good food. The breakfast sandwich was excellent. It has a soothing old-wood vibe with a large layout that works for people looking to catch up on work emails, students, folks wanting to meet up, or locals enjoying their routine. Staff were really nice and attentive.\n\nIt also, looks like it's run by a young couple. So If you're traveling this way head in there, try it out and support the local business.",
