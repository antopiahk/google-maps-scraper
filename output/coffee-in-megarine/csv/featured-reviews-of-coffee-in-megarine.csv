ChIJuRqhv7uUwIcR3_Awkka3Hb0,Maps Coffee & Chocolate,"We were recommended to come here by a friend and I can see why.
It was an amazing experience with an owner that is very present in the business. You can feel the love in the building with their energy and taste it in what they produce.

They sell coffee and chocolate (as is in their name).
The chocolates have samples that are help yourself.

They have a BBQ pop up that comes out I believe on the weekends. I didn't attend that, but was told.

The people who work there are happy to talk to you about their products.
I spent most of my time walking around looking for things to buy so I didn't test out the seating.

As the coffee is roasted there, they can sometimes do custom roasts. I'm not sure as to the requirement involved for that to happen but I was shown some roasts that were special for specific clients.

Parking is available in a shared medium sized lot.",Wai Chan,5,"We were recommended to come here by a friend and I can see why.
