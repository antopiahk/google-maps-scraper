Nestled on King Street and Adjacent to Spencer Avenue, The Abbott is a convenient coffee shop situated for the community.
I keep on coming back to the Abbott whenever I am in the area , and it never fails to disappoint.
I really enjoyed the coffee here and they have a great selection of baked goods as well.",5 months ago,2023-06-29T15:20:12.088000,,,,0,270,2145,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103654633817217064509/reviews?entry=ttu,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWGMmAs0bQx-KYeKAgLyYJHn8Tpdc0l5dHF9--T7Dfk9fA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100,True,,,[]
