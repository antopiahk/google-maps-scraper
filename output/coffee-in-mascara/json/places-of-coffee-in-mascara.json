They were going to remove 2 links on the watch because it was big for my wrist! They tried but the tools to size the watch and remove 2 links broke! Then they told us that they will send the watch to the Bulova Company to size the watch and that we had to wait for 7 to 10 days and they will call us back to pick up the watch to the store. The Manager of the store told us that and we accepted and we where happy and treated with excellent Customer service that day! 15 days passed by and no call from the store so we decided to go today to the Macy's store in the Florida Mall to check what happened to the watch! We talked to 2 different employees who sent us to 2 different places who they did not what to do to solve the problem. Finally we saw the Manager who checked in the computer and found out that the watch was in the store since yesterday! She checked in 2 safes and the watch was not there! Then she called by phone and in the floor there were 2 UPS boxes and there was the watch in one of them! She took the watch out of the box and there were no links and the watch was not done anything for sizing ! The watch was sent by the store to remove 2 links and they did nothing in 15 days! That's no way to treat a Customer! Then they did not have any options for fixing the problem! Then my wife asked the manager if we could go to remove the links in another watch store independent from Macy's and pay for it and come back for a refund and they will deduct that from the watch price and she said yes! We went to a watch store near the dining room and payed 21 dollars for sizing the watch! We came back to Macy's for the refund of the money spend for sizing the watch and we had to wait 1 hour for them to give us the money! I will not recommend this store to anyone! This is a good example of bad treatment to a Customer!",
