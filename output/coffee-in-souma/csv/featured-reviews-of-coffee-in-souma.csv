Their seasonal flavor is this orange blossom which adds well to the already delicious creaminess. The oji pourover was expensive but the flavor profile is simply excellent.

I have been regularly visiting this location for the past 3 years and the folks that work here are phenomenal in every sense of the word. The one suggestion I have for the owners is ventilation. The location is great with beautiful light, however, this sun-drenched location is in need of ventilation upgrades to support staff and patrons alike.  It can heat up like an oven in there at times, and I would love to see the ventilation improved on behalf of the good folks working hard to deliver the best coffee and service in the city.

ChIJZwyy48iBhYARkQwavM7I9pU,Bluestone Lane SOMA Coffee Shop,"I started an internship near bluestone. I have never been a coffee girl but honestly bluestone made me get into coffee. I started buying the hot chocolate and the almond & chia putting both are amazing for a quick breakfast & go. You can order online and just grab. It's kind of expensive since I ordered the hot chocolate and it was around $6-7 ish and it was small(look at pic) and the chia putting is also small and is around $6. The total for only those was $12.31. The chia pudding those make you fill full and is delicious. One problem is that when you order in person they don't give you a receipt and you can really claim your points for the rewards.

ChIJmZa_nCWBhYAR-gWlk5ZX0r0,Haraz Coffee House,"This is a new coffee place at Franklin and Bush, a busy intersection.  This is the second coffee place that's been there in the last few years.  I've been in a couple of times, the first for some pastries, the second for a large black coffee.

First visit for pastries - they have an interesting selection of sweets.  I bought a blueberry muffin and a chocolate hazelnut muffin on the first visit.  The blueberry was mediocre, but the chocolate hazelnut was a nice surprise.  Together, before tax, it was just shy of $12 for the two.

Second visit was just for some coffee.  Plain, black, large.  I thought it would be quick, but it wasn't.  They brew each cup individually, kind of like Vietnamese coffee, so this took longer than I was expecting.  I'm not sure how they manage this if it's busy, but I was not in a rush.  I was a little disappointed that it wasn't a full cup.  Even after adding some cream, there was quite a bit of room left.  The flavor of the coffee reminded me of some of the stronger Turkish coffees I've had.  Price was $6.50, which seemed a little pricey for a not quite full cup of drip coffee.

The guys behind the counter are very nice and helpful.  And, I'm not sure if they have wifi (I assume so), but it seems like a nice neighborhood place to sit and maybe work on the computer or read a book or chat with a friend.  Also, both times, I came in from just having walked my dog, and they didn't seem to have a problem with that.  I wasn't staying, so not sure if dogs are actually allowed.

Overall, I think that the place has potential and I hope that they can stand the test of time!  Having a faster alternative for a standard, black drip coffee would be worth investigating for them.  That corner is a pick up spot for travelers hopping on buses, and if they want a quick coffee, they wouldn't get it there, so maybe offering something a little less artisanal, but quicker, a la Pete's Coffee, would be a good idea!",Chris B,4,"This is a new coffee place at Franklin and Bush, a busy intersection.

Also, both times, I came in from just having walked my dog, and they didn't seem to have a problem with that.  I wasn't staying, so not sure if dogs are actually allowed.

Overall, I think that the place has potential and I hope that they can stand the test of time!  Having a faster alternative for a standard, black drip coffee would be worth investigating for them.  That corner is a pick up spot for travelers hopping on buses, and if they want a quick coffee, they wouldn't get it there, so maybe offering something a little less artisanal, but quicker, a la Pete's Coffee, would be a good idea!",2 months ago,2023-09-14T15:13:23.359000,,,,3,10,4,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107275174661667004878/reviews?entry=ttu,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUGD02ladqfAlbuU75volCNUG3rQdo3nVnISxftYknSBMc=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,False,,,"['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvCunCNFnZgVM4lmaXNcxBki3pAXgmLMoEAtsn=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAn7w2rtdXVx34DOhz9mVTbLUdOBJi3JmtImwl=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd6xRsmZQtgGDD5m1auMaWT2gA0yvu1eBstZl3=w150-h150-k-no-p']"
ChIJmZa_nCWBhYAR-gWlk5ZX0r0,Haraz Coffee House,"The former Klutch Coffee shop has been transformed into Hraz Coffee, a cafe focused on Yemeni coffee. According to the cashier, Yemen was the source of coffee in the 1900s (he mentioned a place called Mocca :)
The pastry case was super tempting so I bought a pistachio cheesecake which they have customed made (like all their desserts). The cheesecake was smooth with a light pistachio flavor and chunks of pistachio nuts. Not overly sweet which is good. The graham cracker crust was firm.
I have to say the Mediterranean savories (phyllo based pies) and sweets (honey cream stuffed bread, cakes, baklava and more) that were on display were impressive.
Only opened 2 weeks!
Love the chill music, the wall art that transport me to a cafe in the eastern Mediterranean or Africa.
This cafe is definitely a relaxing spot. Convenient to CPMC Van Ness, Cathedral Hill, within a short walk to Japantown and one block off Van Ness.
