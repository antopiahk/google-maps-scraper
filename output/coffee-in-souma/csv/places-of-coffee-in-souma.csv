(a year ago)

Answer: I believe only one item for vegetarian.  

But if you actually go to their left side of restaurant called , San Toung,  it is an authentic Chinese restaurant that I have been eating since 2008.
You could always see there are always so many people waiting on the line to get in or waiting for to go .

Their steam vegetable dumplings are unbelievable awesomely tasty for  vegetarians.
I strongly  recommend you give it a try ..
Steam vegetable dumplings ( I love it,  the size of dumplings are amazing  )
