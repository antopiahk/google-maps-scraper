You knew what you were ordering.\" After trying to pay for another cup of coffee and talking to the manager (equally rude and unhelpful) we left. The lack of basic kindness and poor customer service skills was upsetting and something I'd never experienced before at Philz. In fact, in the past they always seemed willing to go out of their way to make a good cup of coffee! Perhaps there is a general decline in quality, as we noticed that the tables were dirty when we arrived. We left and went to Starbucks --had a lovely time with friendly people behind the counter, good service, and excellent coffee.",

I will gladly come back.\n\nI had a great experience while the coffee shop was busy. And I hope I do not have the same experience as people who left 1 star reviews. (I can totally picture what they're talking about)",

Hoping to see more Blue Bottle and less Starbucks. We ordered their seasonal NOLA iced coffee and the oji pourover. Their seasonal flavor is this orange blossom which adds well to the already delicious creaminess. The oji pourover was expensive but the flavor profile is simply excellent. It was strong yet super smooth. My only problem with Blue Bottle is the price point. I mean coffee is expensive in general if you're not going for the $1 McCafe coffee from Mickey Dees.",

Was looking for a breakfast spot with some good coffee, and we ended up here at Beanstalk.\n\nThe Food: I went with a \"Lox Bagel\" and a \"Dirty Chai Latte\". The Lox bagel was good! Had a good amount of lox on the bagel, with plenty of greens to pair it with. I enjoyed it a lot. The Dirty Chai Latte was delicious as well. That Chai flavor was well there and it wasn't too sweet.\n\nThe Service: Service was good. Staff were friendly. This place can get really busy in the morning, so come early or be prepared to wait for a bit. However, the food/drinks do come out in a timely manner.\n\nThe Atmosphere: This spot is quite small. Not that many places to sit here, so most of the time I saw people just ordering their foods to go.\n\nOverall, a 4/5. Very good breakfast spot to grab yourself a bagel/sandwich and some coffee. I'd recommend giving this place a try.",

Service was average though the barista did share he was a highly satisfied regular patron before taking the job. That's always a good sign. What makes this establishment special is a secluded courtyard in the back that allows one to bask in the sun while enjoying private space - right in the heart of busy, industrial SoMa district.

I have been regularly visiting this location for the past 3 years and the folks that work here are phenomenal in every sense of the word. The one suggestion I have for the owners is ventilation. The location is great with beautiful light, however, this sun-drenched location is in need of ventilation upgrades to support staff and patrons alike.  It can heat up like an oven in there at times, and I would love to see the ventilation improved on behalf of the good folks working hard to deliver the best coffee and service in the city.\n\nBravo Sightglass staff, you are the best!!!",

The person taking my order was very patient.

The staff are awesome (and underpaid). The wifi IS ALWAYS OUT. The decor is really terrible. The atmosphere really takes a hit because they don't even try to make it look nice. Pay people better and take care of your place. Fix your wifi. (I'm really grumpy because I have a huge project due and was banking on being able to work at your coffee shop for a few hours. Spent money and then couldn't work there!)",

The staff are awesome (and underpaid). The wifi IS ALWAYS OUT. The decor is really terrible. The atmosphere really takes a hit because they don't even try to make it look nice. Pay people better and take care of your place. Fix your wifi. (I'm really grumpy because I have a huge project due and was banking on being able to work at your coffee shop for a few hours. Spent money and then couldn't work there!)",

After being seated for less than 20 minutes, the \"assistant manager\" came up to me, headphones on and deep in studying, to ask if I was going to buy something...Concentration ruined, ugh...I was taken aback. I always spend money when I go to a cafe, but shame on me for not doing so the second I walked in the door I suppose... Maybe this location has an issue with loitering, due to its close proximity to the dorms? This could also explain the employees overall attitude. I informed her that yes, I was going to purchase a drink and a snack; Nevertheless, it was not a tactful or pleasant interaction, and I was unhappy to be interrupted in the middle of my work for what I consider an insulting reason...Does every customer receive this shakedown? Is it so uncommon to find a seat before going to the counter, that it warranted confrontation? Or possibly, am I just special? :) I'm no rookie to coffee shops, I've studied for hours prior to getting coffee and have never experienced this treatment anywhere. If I do return to this location, I'll buy my coffee immediately, to avoid interruption and being mistaken for a loiterer...Overall, the place left a bad taste in my mouth, which certainly wasn't from the coffee or delicious baked goods...It's a shame, because I love the other two Soma's in B-Town, and this one is the closest to my apartment. But alas, employees make-or-break the coffee-shop experience, and because of this, I will be going elsewhere in the future.",

The rose latte is definitely sweeter of the two but we appreciated how strong the rose flavor was.\n\nWe have also tried the banana bread here which was pretty solid (especially when heated up) but was very expensive for the size so probably wouldn't get it again. Also there isn't much seating other than an outdoor bench so expect to take your coffee to-go!\n\nOverall, love the coffee here and will definitely be coming back!!",

I started buying the hot chocolate and the almond & chia putting both are amazing for a quick breakfast & go. You can order online and just grab. It's kind of expensive since I ordered the hot chocolate and it was around $6-7 ish and it was small(look at pic) and the chia putting is also small and is around $6. The total for only those was $12.31. The chia pudding those make you fill full and is delicious. One problem is that when you order in person they don't give you a receipt and you can really claim your points for the rewards.\nOn the other hand, the location is always clean and the staff is always soooo nice. They are always smiling. It became one of my favorite coffee places <3  also really aesthetic for instagram",

I've been in a couple of times, the first for some pastries, the second for a large black coffee.\n\nFirst visit for pastries - they have an interesting selection of sweets.  I bought a blueberry muffin and a chocolate hazelnut muffin on the first visit.  The blueberry was mediocre, but the chocolate hazelnut was a nice surprise.  Together, before tax, it was just shy of $12 for the two.\n\nSecond visit was just for some coffee.  Plain, black, large.  I thought it would be quick, but it wasn't.  They brew each cup individually, kind of like Vietnamese coffee, so this took longer than I was expecting.  I'm not sure how they manage this if it's busy, but I was not in a rush.  I was a little disappointed that it wasn't a full cup.  Even after adding some cream, there was quite a bit of room left.  The flavor of the coffee reminded me of some of the stronger Turkish coffees I've had.  Price was $6.50, which seemed a little pricey for a not quite full cup of drip coffee.\n\nThe guys behind the counter are very nice and helpful.  And, I'm not sure if they have wifi (I assume so), but it seems like a nice neighborhood place to sit and maybe work on the computer or read a book or chat with a friend.  Also, both times, I came in from just having walked my dog, and they didn't seem to have a problem with that.  I wasn't staying, so not sure if dogs are actually allowed.\n\nOverall, I think that the place has potential and I hope that they can stand the test of time!  Having a faster alternative for a standard, black drip coffee would be worth investigating for them.  That corner is a pick up spot for travelers hopping on buses, and if they want a quick coffee, they wouldn't get it there, so maybe offering something a little less artisanal, but quicker, a la Pete's Coffee, would be a good idea!",

It took about 20 minutes to get our two drinks with only two other groups who ordered before us. But benefit of the doubt, they've literally only been open for about a week, so they're probably still dialing in their staff, recipes, and techniques!\n\nAmbiance is quiet and calm. Great space to bring a laptop and get some work done, or sit down with a good book. Love the eclectic style of the cafe too.\n\nOverall, excited to come back and try something else!",
