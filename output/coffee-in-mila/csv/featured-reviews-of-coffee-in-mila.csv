First of all, be ready to wait 10-20 minutes in a queue outside unless it is 8 am or 9 pm. The inside is of course quite crowded as well.

Secondly, the endless waiting time doesn't finish at the door. For placing your order and getting it you will need to wait again (overall, might be up to 40 minutes in total. Ridiculous for such places that are not restaurants).

Finally, the drinks are indeed good (especially, if you opt for artisan ones). But again, the famous one with olive oil seems to be sold out all the time.
The food is okay - with an Italian twist but nothing special and overpriced.

It's going to be the most unique Starbucks experience. It's expensive to dine but worth the taste and experience. Customer service and hospitality is 10/10.

4 floors to explore from beans to pizza, pastry, variety of coffee and mixed drinks.

It has escalators and elevator. Plenty of well maintained restrooms and a lot of seating place to dine.

This cafe is located right next to the park. The ambience is all in pink and cute to click photos. However I think it was quite crowded for me to click some! The crockery is also so lovely!  They also had some coffee powder packets for selling purpose!

I tried their Cappuccino for 2.5 euros.

They don't provide sugar in their cafe. As someone coming from India, I am used to drink coffee with sugar. But they explained that they use the coffee beans grown by local farmers and to maintain the authenticity, they prefer brewing the coffee with its natural taste! To be honest, I would have loved sugar, but without that, it tasted par excellence too! I had it in the morning and I can still feel the taste and aroma as I recollect! Really a must try if you are in Milan. You surely would not regret it.

ChIJb16-F93zNIgRHTza1dKHLho,De Fer Coffee & Tea,"De Fer... More like De Awesome!

De Fer Coffee in the Strip District is a step above mostly all other coffee shops I have ever been to based on the level of service, quality of the coffee, existence of wine & beer offerings, and the ambiance of the cafe.

The owners and managers hit home runs when hiring their staff.  Every employee was knowledgeable, friendly, enthusiastic, and genuine.  I regret not remembering employee names because they all deserve so much recognition for doing a great job.  I was at De Fer on Sunday, October 8th doing some work for about an hour around 4:00pm.  The Steelers had just beat the Ravens!

The drip coffee was some of the best I've ever had.  I purchased some whole beans that I can't wait to get into at home.  I did not partake in the wine & beer offerings.  However, it is pretty rare to find a coffee roaster that also has a liquor license for wine and beer sales.  I really want to visit Pittsburgh again just to check out more of De Fer's offerings.

The cafe is busy!  However, the staff do an unbelievable job ensuring a good experience by bringing drinks and food to the tables instead of the customary crowd of caffeine deprived customers standing around the drink bar eagerly awaiting for their name to be mispronounced.  It's just a cool space in a redeveloped industrial building with a lot of great neighborhoody things popping up around.

ChIJE07db9LJj4AR5cDo8MgwYqo,1 Oz Coffee,"Overall: 3.6/5

This place is in the center of the business center and is super cute. There are plenty of seating areas for you to choose from. The two ladies that worked there were very nice & polite.

Uber Latte With Oat Milk & A Shot of Espresso ($9.25): The price for this latte is ridiculous & not worth it. The ube latte base price is $7.50 + $0.50 for oat milk + $1.25 for the espresso shot.  The cup was pretty small too. The ube latte is pretty with the nice purple color and lavender garnished on top. I barely tasted the ube. The espresso was the primary taste but besides that, the latte was balanced.

Almond Cake ($5): This was not bad but not as good as an almond croissant/bear claw. This cake had a pound cake texture so it was dense but not very sweet. I wouldn't get it again.",Angelica Le,4,"Overall: 3.6/5
