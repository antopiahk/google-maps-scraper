There is quite often a queue outside and the entrance is managed as to leave inside always more clients than the available seats. As per my experience, you better add a 2 EUR table charge per person and head to the upper floor where you have more chances to find yourself a seat and you get table service too.",

There is quite often a queue outside and the entrance is managed as to leave inside always more clients than the available seats.

You can find paid street parking around the corner, might be a task during the weekend. Attached some of my snaps from this place below.....",

I ordered at the front and paid at the front and they charged table service and told me that it is normal in all of Milan. Uhm, no it's not, I have never been to a cafe and charged table service. I am very disappointed. Go to any cafe in Milan and you will be charged less than EUR5 for the same and have a much better experience.",

They also had some coffee powder packets for selling purpose!\n\nI tried their Cappuccino for 2.5 euros.\n\nThey don't provide sugar in their cafe. As someone coming from India, I am used to drink coffee with sugar. But they explained that they use the coffee beans grown by local farmers and to maintain the authenticity, they prefer brewing the coffee with its natural taste! To be honest, I would have loved sugar, but without that, it tasted par excellence too! I had it in the morning and I can still feel the taste and aroma as I recollect! Really a must try if you are in Milan. You surely would not regret it.\n\nKudos to the service staff! Excellent job and quite friendly people greeting with smiling faces!

I got a nitro cold brew to go for later and it was also delicious! Great vibe to this place and cool art on the walls. Super stoked to find a good shop coming from Cali.",

Every employee was knowledgeable, friendly, enthusiastic, and genuine.  I regret not remembering employee names because they all deserve so much recognition for doing a great job.  I was at De Fer on Sunday, October 8th doing some work for about an hour around 4:00pm.  The Steelers had just beat the Ravens!\n\nThe drip coffee was some of the best I've ever had.  I purchased some whole beans that I can't wait to get into at home.  I did not partake in the wine & beer offerings.  However, it is pretty rare to find a coffee roaster that also has a liquor license for wine and beer sales.  I really want to visit Pittsburgh again just to check out more of De Fer's offerings.\n\nThe cafe is busy!  However, the staff do an unbelievable job ensuring a good experience by bringing drinks and food to the tables instead of the customary crowd of caffeine deprived customers standing around the drink bar eagerly awaiting for their name to be mispronounced.  It's just a cool space in a redeveloped industrial building with a lot of great neighborhoody things popping up around.\n\nWay to go De Fer.",

My favorite is the latte and the chicken bacon panini.\n\nThe staff here are all super friendly and it has such nice ambience and it's a place that you will want to keep going back to, as the staff treat you as a friend, with respect and dignity no matter who you are.\n\nI've seen them give homeless gentlemen sitting outside on the curb, coffee's once in a while in the rain.\n\n I wouldn't be surprised if they do that daily  because that's just what type of quality people work here.\n\nThe manager Ash is a real kind woman who takes great pride in her Cafe and employees and has excellent attention to detail for Milano. It's always clean in there, and honestly, words can't even describe what a great little place this is.  I highly recommend it! ",

The two ladies that worked there were very nice & polite.\n\nUber Latte With Oat Milk & A Shot of Espresso ($9.25): The price for this latte is ridiculous & not worth it. The ube latte base price is $7.50 + $0.50 for oat milk + $1.25 for the espresso shot.  The cup was pretty small too. The ube latte is pretty with the nice purple color and lavender garnished on top. I barely tasted the ube. The espresso was the primary taste but besides that, the latte was balanced.\n\nAlmond Cake ($5): This was not bad but not as good as an almond croissant/bear claw. This cake had a pound cake texture so it was dense but not very sweet. I wouldn't get it again.",

Plus, it's dog friendly! I took photos of the menus and the location, so check out my photos to get a feel for what 1 Oz coffee has to offer!",
