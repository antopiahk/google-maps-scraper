I got their cold brew flight, it was amazing! The Whiskey Barrel Aged coffee was my favourite, it was absolutely wonderful. Highly recommend it! It does get quite busy here though, and they do sell out of their food relatively fast. We stopped here 3 times on our trip, and one time I was unable to get the sandwich I wanted since it sold out so fast. To be far we arrived around 11am. The other two times we went, we went around 8-9am and had little to no issues finding a table, and had no issues with food items being sold out. I would say you should plan on stopping here in advance and go earlier to ensure you can get whatever item you want on the menu, and to ensure you get a decent table. Also the atmosphere was incredibly cool, it's awesome to just come in here and check it out. So beautiful!",

The layout of the place is a bit crammed however, the line is long and there isn't room to freely move from the pickup area to the tables when there's a long line. There's a fair amount of tables and chairs but they're not the most comfortable/cozy. I saw one comfy chair but that's about it, therefore it's not a place I would sit and hang out at for a while but I did like the vibe. The sandwhich was fine but I didn't care for the Matcha. My friend got the Mayan mocha and that was good.",

A lounge/bar at night - hubs saw a whiskey still in there. Great to come and just hangout and work if you don't mind paying a little extra for a fancy cup of coffee. Hubs got the Ginger latte which I enjoyed more than him. I thought my matcha latte was supposed to have everything a ginger latte had but it was just a regular matcha latte but still good. The ham and cheese croissant didn't seem super fresh out the oven which was a bit disappointing (8:30 am). Bacon and sausage egg bagels were good. Not exceptional for the price I'm paying. Great vibe and atmosphere.\nWe had our baby with us and people were nice about it (thankfully she wasn't too fussy lol)",

The iced coffee was perfect, and I normally don't like black coffee.\n\nThe food was fantastic. Yes, expensive, but you can tell the ingredients are super high quality, so it makes sense. The yogurt and Granola was just the right amount of sweet, and they didn't skimp at all on the Granola or nuts. The burrito was so flavorful. I couldn't find hot sauce, but it was not needed at all.

Now normally I put GF free cakes in the same category as I do with hardtak biscuits, but Perfect Blend proves that not all things GF free must be moisture free too.\n\nMy particular cake was lemon themed, with a whipped cream frosting, a very pound cake like base, and a strange lemon pudding filling in the center kept there by a ring of thick butter cream frosting.\n\nReally liked the cake itself, nice and basic, lots of volume and with that pound cake-like quality had a touch of moisture. The whipped topping was also an easy A+, paired perfectly with the cake. The inner pudding was, odd, not as powerful in terms of lemon but its consistency was what really had us pondering. The only part I feel like maybe could use some work was the ring of butter cream they used to seal in the pudding, it was just so sweet, like, overkill sweetness. And it had no lemon flavor, just rich and sweet like regular buttercream does.\n\nStill, given this is a GF free cake, I will grant it full marks.",

We ordered brownies, cookies and cupcakes, as well as GF and V/GF cupcakes! THEY WERE DELICIOUS! We will absolutely be using them for more events in the future. Austin was very upfront and honest about what they were able to do, and everything can out perfect under such short notice! Everyone at the party raved about how great their desserts were, and even the vegan and gluten-free folks said it was some of the best desserts they have ever had! 100/10 stars if I could rate them that!",

The cake itself was moist and delicious! The person who waited on me could not have been more delightful!  What was remarkable to me was how friendly and kind the patrons inside the cafe were?!  Every single person looked at me, smiled and said hello?! I will definitely return to this place every time that I am in town!",

She even rolled her eyes to show her contempt.\n\nI have lived in New York for more than 10 years and have not written any negative reviews for service staff, because I have not had any unpleasant experiences. I was shocked by the lady's attitude.\n\nI've been living in the area for three years. I used to occasionally visit this restaurant, but haven't come over in the past few months. The restaurant is quite good, both in terms of food and drink quality. I just don't understand why the shop owner would hire such a mean, rude and impolite person?\n\nDue to the impatient attitude of this lady, I rushly ordered breakfast without seeing the menu clearly,as I didn't eat pork and beef, I left without taking a few bites.",

I had the breakfast plate which came with scrambled eggs, fingerling potatoes, and sausage patties. Everything was delicious. Breakfast is my favorite meal and I will def be back to try the other amazing sounding dishes. The place itself looks very modern with lots of charm. The staff was so kind and friendly. Easily one of the best spots in the area.",

I also got a brisket combo sandwich.\nHot and fresh!  Tender! The fries are nicely seasoned without it being overwhelming. The sandwich has pickles and sauce nicely done with presentation on the plate.  The price is not bad considering the price of meat these days and I'm deeply impressed by tenderness of the meat.\nI snagged a catering menu just in case I am in a situation that might call for it. Will be coming back.  <3",

Nice music in background.\nWe ordered destachio latte and pour over coffee both were good. At billing place they have some good desserts on display.  We got pistachio cannoli and coffee cream vanilla both were good.\nFaced a problem with customer service, I was standing in queue to order cannoli and they had coffee cream cannoli on display with 2 counts . Person ahead of me did order one of them.  After that when I went I asked them do you have 2 cannoli he said yes and immediately billed for it and made me pay. After paying he immediately said oh let me check if we have 2 cannoli . This was same person who took order for person ahead of me same . He went inside and said we are out actually for one the order was placed before you. He said you can get something else in that place. And I got one more pistachio cannoli for which he made me pay again and said from previous order the money would be refunded.  It was his mistake  Instead he could have said I will process refund if he cannot adjust with same money.\nIn other places if such mistake happens they atleast try to adjust the money and that what I felt.\nOverall would say coffee is good , dessert are good.",

And I ordered mine regular which they use chocolate milk for, and it was amazing! I absolutely cannot wait until these small coffee shops open again for indoor dine in because the ambiance of this place is so cool. Only issue is that parking might not be that easy to find since it is paid street parking. This place is worth the walk, though!

Highly recommend if you're looking for professional coffee with an amazing atmosphere.",

This place was the perfect choice! There is both outdoor and indoor seating available, but it was a hot Fall day so we opted for the air conditioned interior. We were able to sit in peace, enjoy our delicious coffees, and share conversation.\n\nMy dad is SUPER particular about his coffee and he greatly enjoyed a cup of their regular drip coffee. I opted for a cold brew with heavy cream and it was probably THE BEST cold brew I have ever had! It was so rich and creamy with no bitter aftertaste. The pumpkin pecan scone I ordered on the side was dense, rich, and flavorful.\n\nYou can tell they put a lot of love and pride into their business. The owner even came over to say hi and tell us about the coffees we ordered. She was genuinely warm and caring, almost like she was welcoming us to her home. Definitely a local business I will be supporting during my future visits to Peoria! Give them try for your next coffee fix!",

The area is safe and the coffee shop couldn't be better staffed or more clean. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff-they know their coffee and are happy to make recommendations. I loved their pour over so much I am ordering beans from them for my French press at home. Their matcha was very good-not too sweat but not bitter either. Their peanut butter and banana toast was a great mid-morning snack that hit the spot after a long  morning walk.",

I also grabbed a vegan Gouda and bell pepper kolache which was not bad, but I would not get one again, was looking for more of a pop of flavour. The staff were super attentive and friendly. There was a lot of books to check out on the walls and lots of coffee merch to grab if you decide you want to up your brewing game at home. Great shop and I hope them lots of success.",

It has quite a spacious patio to sit and hang out if you want and the actual store is much bigger on the inside than it looks.\n\nI ended up ordering one of their specialty lattes - the ube honey latte - and OMG I loved it!  So unique and tasty... even a random patron walking in parking lot was like wow your drink looks so good.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try their other coffee drinks and maybe even a pastry!",

The only reason I give 4 stars is that they don't have any wifi!!! I came here with the intent of getting some work done and could have seen this being a place where I came often to get things done, but sadly will have to find somewhere else. Great place to bring friends though!",

The vegan treats were so tasty, especially the Bac'n Cheddar Turnover. The vibe was great. Loved the plants and the cool artwork on the front. The owner was very friendly. Can't wait to come back.",

There is also a small covered outside seating area you just want to park and get some fresh air.  If you give your phone number you can quickly be signed up for their rewards points system that tracks your history and gives you free drinks and perks etc.  Price wasn't that bad and server was very happy with the tip I left.

The attention to detail in their brews and the sleek atmosphere made my experience truly memorable, if I ever find myself in Savannah again I will definitely be back!

The pods are really nice and accommodating!  My first time at Vel I ordered a coffee and had a zoom meeting inside the solo pod and I fell in love!!! You can ether book a pod on their app or walk in and book it.  They also have a variety of drinks including my favorite Spring Forward.

In my opinion, it was very pricey compared to other similar coffee shops for a regular iced latte... but, given the area it's located in, I guess I it is par for the course. The coffee itself was good, but definitely not the best I've ever had especially given the price. Additionally, $1 extra for skim milk is pretty ridiculous. Skim milk is not an \"milk alternative ,\" it is still a form of cow's milk just like 2% and whole milk and is priced the same at any grocery store, unlike almond and oat milk, which are truly more expensive. This is a little excessive to me. But to each their own.\n\nFinally, if you're coming in for studying, work, or anything on the computer, I might recommend elsewhere. Their WiFi was painfully slow for me and barely loaded anything at all during my visit. I ended up just closing my laptop and heading home. Chairs and tables were very limited inside as well, but looking at reviews, they are waiting on another shipment, so I'm sure this will change soon.\n\nOverall, cute place and good coffee, but it could work on a few things.",

We'd be more than happy to provide you with a gift card to make up for that mistake! \n\nWe were aware of the issue on the Wi-Fi, and we had to spend a chunk of time working through reboots & customizing settings with AT&T on Friday. If you've had a problem since then, please let us know because we are trying to stay on top of that, and will consider increasing our internet speeds if needed.\n\nHopefully the last round of seats will arrive soon! That's been a challenge, but, we'll have it fixed soon! Please feel free to shoot me a message directly if there's anything else I can be of help with!\n\n-Doug\nhello@mythandlegend.coffee",

The lattes were great but they only offer 8 and 12 oz. We had asked for our coffee to go with one in a personal cup and they made both lattes for \"here\" so that was kind of annoying. We did try some food from the cafe. We tried the avocado toast which was really good but it says it is \"sharable\" and it was just 1 piece of bread cut in 2 pieces so I don't know if I would consider that sharable.

I am glad I didn't go into the Peets!\n\nI ordered a 16oz Americano and the English muffins sandwich with bacon and miso egg and microgreens. The sandwich was AMAZING! I have never had a house made English muffins and now I don't think I could go back to the regular ones at the store. The bacon on the sandwich was thick, so every bite I had there was a flavorful bit of everything. My Americano was smooth and went well with oat milk.\n\nThey offer free water inside, which was nice after my long walk. The cafe was pretty warm, so I sat outside. Ambiance is alright, but gets the street noise of busy Solano and direct sun at the tables.\n\nI definitely want to introduce my friends to this place!",

I wanted something different (seasonal drink) but we just opted for traditional mochas. Again, couldn't be more happy with the service.

Enough about the ambiance though.\nI came to get some studying done and got a cold brew. It was fruity and floral, and it being a cold brew, had a very low level of acidity. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a \"no-nonsense\" caffeinated drink.\nFor some odd reason, I had the idea to test the speed of their internet. This is something I don't believe I've ever done at other cafes, but I'm glad I did. On December 4, 2021, Coffee Signal achieved upload speeds of 290 Mbps. That is insanely fast, even compared to home Internet standards, and ungodly compared to cafe Internet standards. As of late, I've experienced very spotty Wifi at many various Ktown cafes, so if you need dependable and fast internet, I would strongly recommend trying out Coffee Signal. I don't know which provider they used, but I need to get what they got for my home.\nDie to the small size of this plaza, finding parking in the lot will be pretty unlikely. If you're willing to walk a block or two, there is plenty of neighborhood street parking.",
