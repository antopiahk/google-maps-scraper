ChIJsU30zM1qkFQRbnOm1_LBoG0,Starbucks Reserve Roastery,"Definitely recommend stopping here. The quality of the food and drinks is amazing. We had the salmon sandwich and prosciutto sandwich. Both were amazing. I got their cold brew flight, it was amazing! The Whiskey Barrel Aged coffee was my favourite, it was absolutely wonderful. Highly recommend it! It does get quite busy here though, and they do sell out of their food relatively fast. We stopped here 3 times on our trip, and one time I was unable to get the sandwich I wanted since it sold out so fast. To be far we arrived around 11am.

The quality of the food and drinks is amazing. We had the salmon sandwich and prosciutto sandwich. Both were amazing. I got their cold brew flight, it was amazing! The Whiskey Barrel Aged coffee was my favourite, it was absolutely wonderful. Highly recommend it! It does get quite busy here though, and they do sell out of their food relatively fast. We stopped here 3 times on our trip, and one time I was unable to get the sandwich I wanted since it sold out so fast. To be far we arrived around 11am.

ChIJT2QzBYIK3okRXK5CXho94eY,Perfect Blend Cafe & Bakery,"Ouch.

Apparently, the barista has mastered a novel technique for preparing cappuccino: very hot, without burning the steamed milk.

Make that, extremely hot.

So hot, that I was lucky that I had a glass of water on the table to quickly cool my mouth.  At the time, not too painful, just a little tingle...

Two hours later, after I had left the shop, I realized that the coffee had been more than just extremely hot, as I felt skin begin peeling from the roof of my mouth.

And, in retrospect, I realize that I couldn't possibly know if the milk was burned at all.  How could I expect to taste anything?  I must have forgot to use an infrared thermometer, which I will now have to carry with me to every coffee shop.

The baked goods in the display case looked pretty good.  And they were room temperature, so, pretty safe, also.

It may be time for the barista to return to using a thermometer, and avoid injuring another patron.

ChIJtQ6Q-bpECogRCh3HNAnLIts,The Spot Coffee,"When spending the day with my dad, we were looking for a little place to sit and catch up. He is an avid coffee drinker so I looked on Yelp for a local business to try. This place was the perfect choice! There is both outdoor and indoor seating available, but it was a hot Fall day so we opted for the air conditioned interior. We were able to sit in peace, enjoy our delicious coffees, and share conversation.

My dad is SUPER particular about his coffee and he greatly enjoyed a cup of their regular drip coffee. I opted for a cold brew with heavy cream and it was probably THE BEST cold brew I have ever had! It was so rich and creamy with no bitter aftertaste. The pumpkin pecan scone I ordered on the side was dense, rich, and flavorful.

You can tell they put a lot of love and pride into their business. The owner even came over to say hi and tell us about the coffees we ordered. She was genuinely warm and caring, almost like she was welcoming us to her home. Definitely a local business I will be supporting during my future visits to Peoria!

i got honey oat latte. they dont have almond milk; only oat or pistachio milk. the latte was good. perfect amount of sweetness and coffee.

the cafe itself is clean and spacious. friendly service and cute small decor. i forgot
to bring my airpods but it wasn't an issue bc i really like their playlist - such a vibe! oh and the coffee bar seating is awesome, since tables can be close to other people.

they have fast and reliable wifi. it tends to get busy and a bit loud but it didnt really bother me. i get easily irritated with loud noise so.

ChIJfxMulOG_QIYRZL3PyEz7CvI,Un Caffe,"I love everything about Un Caffe except the obnoxious hip hop music, that is just noisy and annoying. As much as I love this place, the rap music makes me want to leave as soon as possible.

But.....

A place for serious coffee people.

Free parking just to the left of it. Water mineralization for coffee. Ramen. Roaster on premises. Legit credentials.

I made second visit the next day and sampled the following: A coffee from Guatemala as a drip coffee, their espresso blend, the Guatemala coffee as an espresso. Of the three, my preference, moving forward is the Guatemala as an espresso, I'll probably try it as an Americano.

There are so many amazing gadgets to peruse. Methods for brewing, compact single use roasters, grinders...things I've read about but never seen in practice.

The music they play here is really bad and annoying hip hop but at least they keep the volume low.

And again, there is free parking just to the left of the place.

There is also a little household cute goods store on the same block.

Highly recommended -- at Un Caffe.
From Roastery Magazine. A review that is better than I could do myself so, here goes:

""A new roastery and coffee bar in Midtown Houston called Un Caffe is giving guests a taste of Italian-style coffee with a distinct focus on craft and performance.

Un Caffe Founder, Roaster and Barista Soonkack Kook also embraces the Italian cultural practice of greeting each guest at the bar.

""They can watch every [drink-making] performance,"" Kook recently told Daily Coffee News. ""I give them surprise drinks. I ask them how their day is going.""Kook, who initially moved to the United States from Korea for college 20 years ago, spent the past 14 months renovating a 1,900-square-foot space inside Un Caffe's 90-year-old building. The result is a modern roastery and retail bar awash in shades of red, green and white, reflecting Kook's reverence for the birthplace of espresso, Italy.

""Espresso is an Italian culture,"" said Kook. ""I get it, light roasting is the trend now, but I wanted to know Italian roasting, too. When my coffee journey began I wanted to learn trendy light roasting, but at the same time I wanted to offer dark roasting to my customers.""

A certified Q Grader and authorized Specialty Coffee Association trainer (AST), Kook is already an expert in coffee, but he credits 2016 Espresso Italiano Champion Daehoon Park with helping him develop his methods for Italian-style coffee.

For lighter roasts, Kook said he embraces a technique known as Environmental Temperature Response Roasting (ETeRR), as developed by Joo Sunghyun, winner of the 2017 Korea Coffee Roasting Championship.
""With green beans having 12-14% moisture at the beginning, as you roast, the water in beans will evaporate,"" Kook said of the technique. ""The amount of the heat should be adjusted depending on how much water is left in the beans, which can be estimated by looking at the environmental ROR [rate of rise].""
At the back of the shop, Kook uses an Ikawa Pro100 sample roaster prior to loading small batches into an Arc 800 roaster or larger production batches in a Probat P12.
Those roast support classic espresso options prepared through a Slayer Steam espresso machine, or drip and cold coffees made with a Ground Control brewing system. The Einspanner, a Viennese drink consisting of espresso topped with a small amount of whipped cream, is another European import by way of Korea.

""Einspanner is a popular drink in Korea, and you don't see the drink here,"" said Kook.

A one-person operation on most days, Un Caffe is not pursuing wholesale accounts, although the capacity is there. For now, Kook said he wants Un Caffe to be a friendly coffee resource for the community while he continues to develop his own skills.

""I feel the love from the community and I want to keep this vibe,"" said Kook. ""I want my shop to be a place for all my present and future friends and community.""",Jay Francis,5,"I love everything about Un Caffe except the obnoxious hip hop music, that is just noisy and annoying.

ChIJ24aPl7-F9YgRgm3JuOLHLeI,Myth & Legend,"Tried this place over the weekend. In my opinion, it was very pricey compared to other similar coffee shops for a regular iced latte... but, given the area it's located in, I guess I it is par for the course. The coffee itself was good, but definitely not the best I've ever had especially given the price. Additionally, $1 extra for skim milk is pretty ridiculous. Skim milk is not an ""milk alternative ,"" it is still a form of cow's milk just like 2% and whole milk and is priced the same at any grocery store, unlike almond and oat milk, which are truly more expensive. This is a little excessive to me. But to each their own.

Finally, if you're coming in for studying, work, or anything on the computer, I might recommend elsewhere. Their WiFi was painfully slow for me and barely loaded anything at all during my visit. I ended up just closing my laptop and heading home. Chairs and tables were very limited inside as well, but looking at reviews, they are waiting on another shipment, so I'm sure this will change soon.

We're sorry about the upcharge on the skim milk- that was actually a mistake on our part, so thank you for pointing that out! We'd be more than happy to provide you with a gift card to make up for that mistake! 

We were aware of the issue on the Wi-Fi, and we had to spend a chunk of time working through reboots & customizing settings with AT&T on Friday. If you've had a problem since then, please let us know because we are trying to stay on top of that, and will consider increasing our internet speeds if needed.

Hopefully the last round of seats will arrive soon! That's been a challenge, but, we'll have it fixed soon! Please feel free to shoot me a message directly if there's anything else I can be of help with!

The lattes were great but they only offer 8 and 12 oz. We had asked for our coffee to go with one in a personal cup and they made both lattes for ""here"" so that was kind of annoying. We did try some food from the cafe.

ChIJAQAwMIuKUocR_e2270A9cJA,Logos Coffee,"stopped in out of curiosity for a coffee shop with a modbar, and was impressed with sapphire's friendly service, ability to talk about the individual coffees, and attention to detail in brewing. and i was pretty much blown away at the quality of the coffee. i wouldn't expect an experience of this level everytime, and maybe i got a little lucky, but i know a perfect extraction on an espresso AND a pour over doesn't just happen by chance.

pour over of a naturally dried costa rica:

balance: 8.5/10 sometimes you just get a perfectly extracted coffee!
clarity: 8.5/10 clean cup allowing a solid exploration of its qualities.
acidity: 8/10 crisp and refreshing acidity of a pink wine.
sweetness: 8/10 clearly strawberries.
body: jk
satisfaction factor: 8/10 the kind of cup where the first sip makes you stop in your tracks, and even if you weren't planning on finishing it, it disappears before you finish your review.

espresso: brazil/natural ethiopia: 7.5/10
thick shot with a crema that lingers until the last sip, it's pleasant brightness is balanced with a deep fresh fruit sweetness. not nutty like you'd expect from a brazil, not chocolatey, more like an SO ethiopia with the edges rounded a bit.",joe dygert,5,"stopped in out of curiosity for a coffee shop with a modbar, and was impressed with sapphire's friendly service, ability to talk about the individual coffees, and attention to detail in brewing. and i was pretty much blown away at the quality of the coffee. i wouldn't expect an experience of this level everytime, and maybe i got a little lucky, but i know a perfect extraction on an espresso AND a pour over doesn't just happen by chance.

It's the best coffee I've tasted in Pittsburgh. The flavor of the coffee is not watered down and they have so many flavors. The customer service is 10 out of 10. There are so many inspirational quotes around the coffee shop and their faith is openly expressed throughout.

ChIJhewNG6u5woARPR3DQJ09Zsc,Coffee Signal,"While Coffee Signal is located on the insanely busy street of Western, you'll find that the interior and ambiance of this shop reminds you of a small, boutique coffee shop located in a suburban neighborhood. Life seems to slow down when you walk through their doors when you see customers silently working/studying and small groups of friends leisurely chatting away. Enough about the ambiance though.
I came to get some studying done and got a cold brew. It was fruity and floral, and it being a cold brew, had a very low level of acidity. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a ""no-nonsense"" caffeinated drink.
For some odd reason, I had the idea to test the speed of their internet. This is something I don't believe I've ever done at other cafes, but I'm glad I did. On December 4, 2021, Coffee Signal achieved upload speeds of 290 Mbps. That is insanely fast, even compared to home Internet standards, and ungodly compared to cafe Internet standards. As of late, I've experienced very spotty Wifi at many various Ktown cafes, so if you need dependable and fast internet, I would strongly recommend trying out Coffee Signal. I don't know which provider they used, but I need to get what they got for my home.
Die to the small size of this plaza, finding parking in the lot will be pretty unlikely.
