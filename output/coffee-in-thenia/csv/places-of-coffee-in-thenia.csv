(a year ago)

Answer: So unfortunately, due to state laws you would only be able to have your cat in the coffee house for a very brief moment. 
It is in violation of health codes etc. and the coffee house would be fined for allowing such violations. 
Please refer to the Texas State Food Establishment rules.
The good news is you and your cat would be allowed to openly dine out on the patio. Just go when the sun goes down so you two won't burn in this Houston humidity. 

But please go. The coffee is nothing short of AMAZING.

I hope this answers your question.
