ChIJo2_21J_AQIYR-Ojk3RsXD9w,Campesino Coffee House,"A home turned into such a cute cozy coffee shop with delicious coffee. There is limited parking in front and the side of the building. There is a new big parking lot behind the coffee shop that you are able to park at.

Multiple sitting: bar style, couches, table seating, and patio seating.

If you enjoy your coffee there then you get a mug to enjoy it in.

I loved the cafe con leches. No hint of bitter coffee and not sweet. Deliciousness in a cup.

ChIJo2_21J_AQIYR-Ojk3RsXD9w,Campesino Coffee House,"We ordered lattes, cafe de olla, chicken and corn tamales, marranito (piggy) and empanadas.

Honestly the food was very good.
The latte was delicious. And the marranito tasted well. Some places the marranito is hard or doesn't have flavor. This one tasted recently made.

My only complaint here was the price of the tamales. As a Hispanic person when I saw they charge $10 for ONE tamale I was taken back. I can get half a dozen for the same price that taste amazing.

Either way I ordered two because I'm a sucker for tamales with coffee. And they were good, thankfully. Because if I had paid $20 for two tamales and they tasted back I probably would have asked them for a refund out of principal.

The place is clean and quiet and was filled with millennials studying on their computers (typical heights area ambiance).

That's sad to hear but we've had the same crew there for the past couple of years but we opted to serve higher quality single original espresso on bar recently, which is noticably less chocolate-y. My wife Liza, the other founder is there every day. It's also sad that it sounds like you have had great drinks and the one day you got a mediocre drink is when we got a not-so-great review from you. Hope you can come by again to give another try, as I'm sure our quality is far higher than Blue Bottle. I am a former BB veteran and know their process well, we are also not owned by Nestle and pay our employees higher .

The one thing I really can't stand and don't get the hype over is the moon milk. It has a very odd flavor. It's often compared to Starbucks sweet cream but in my opinion is no comparison at all. I've read it has several ingredients to make up it's flavor and texture. To me, it just doesn't work and ruins the drink.
The rest is fine tho.",a month ago,2023-10-17T13:46:29.160000,"Thank you for providing feedback, Alicia. We in fact do use Cake and Bacon for all of our pastries at our SW Houston locations. We also understand that our moon milk is not for everyone. We do however, also offer a wide variety of traditional lattes and coffees as well. Just ask our baristas the next time you drop by and well gladly make something great for you. We strive for exceptional customer experiences.
