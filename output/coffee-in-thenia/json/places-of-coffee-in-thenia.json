Just go when the sun goes down so you two won't burn in this Houston humidity. \n\nBut please go. The coffee is nothing short of AMAZING.\n\nI hope this answers your question.",

As a Hispanic person when I saw they charge $10 for ONE tamale I was taken back. I can get half a dozen for the same price that taste amazing.\n\nEither way I ordered two because I'm a sucker for tamales with coffee. And they were good, thankfully. Because if I had paid $20 for two tamales and they tasted back I probably would have asked them for a refund out of principal.\n\nThe place is clean and quiet and was filled with millennials studying on their computers (typical heights area ambiance).\n\nOverall I'd come again.",

My critique is just how elitist and unfriendly the baristas were. I went in with a very chill 3 year old got several drinks and pastries and it was SO unfriendly. It was like I lived in Seattle again! I'll go back for coffee but only if some of the warmer places aren't open. The thing Indiana does well is warmth...even hipsters here tend to be friendly...but not today.",

They called me for my drink and without thinking, I left the bag of beans that I had purchased on one of the tables next to the couch. I left the store and did not realize until much later in the day when I was already out of Indy that I had left the beans there. My wife emailed the following day to see if there was anything they could do. She received a response from Jess Magness, General Manager, and they ended up shipping the bag of beans that I purchased along with some stickers. Incredible coffee and customer service!",

The coffee drink I got (I believe it's called Juneberry, or at least something similar) was visually pleasing but the only that really sets them apart from other places is presentation. It was pretty expensive for a small cup. For students, if you have a good pair of noise canceling headphones, go right ahead.\n\nThe place is really cute anyway. I would come back for the vibes if I'm in the area.",

Their coffee beans are top-notch - I could tell right after that first sip of the Americano. It seemed a bit plain at first, but turned out to be incredibly smooth. The Alpinist was decent, but I'd suggest sticking to the classics if you want to savor that rich coffee aroma.",

Fine, but seriously it's a slice of tomato. The soup was so gelatinous I couldn't eat it - thick tasteless goop. And every time I blinked a new bug was attacking my food (see photos).

I don't know what kind of 'egg product' was used, but it was the worst taste and consistency Ive ever had in an egg. It was super thick (at least an inch tall), tasteless and the consistency is hard to describe. The bagel it was on was fine, but that egg thing was really gross.",

My wife Liza, the other founder is there every day. It's also sad that it sounds like you have had great drinks and the one day you got a mediocre drink is when we got a not-so-great review from you. Hope you can come by again to give another try, as I'm sure our quality is far higher than Blue Bottle. I am a former BB veteran and know their process well, we are also not owned by Nestle and pay our employees higher .\n\n-Rich\n",

The drink was so flavor packed with what was evident that it was made with quality ingredients. It took me no time to devour the drink.\n\nCustomer service: The gentleman taking my order recommended a great option tailored to my drink presences. The suggestion turned out to exceed my expectations as the drink was delicious.\n\nLocation: I used the drive through to access this location. The drive through was a seemingly quick experience as it was not busy at the time of my visit. There seemed to be lots of parking available.\n\nI would definitely visit this location again!",

There's indoor seating, outdoor seating, and also a drive thru. The customer service is good. I got a matcha moon latte on my first visit and I was honestly a little hesitant because I always get just a matcha latte at coffee shops, but this drink turned out to be so delicious. This coffee shop is known for their fire roasted coffee and moon milk that is a \"blend of seven secret ingredients- rich, sweet, creamy goodness!\" I'll be back for sure!",

There's a community bulletin board, food drive bin, and eclectic art referencing music and neighborhoods a Houston \"Native\" will recognize right away. Plants and chill music give a relaxed vibe. Great place to bring a friend or first date, or to study.  Coffee was very good and service efficient and friendly. Yay! I love supporting a local Houston business.\nDon't miss the wonderful historic Gregory School murals and the Historic Freedman's Town marker when in the area. There is a lot of fascinating history in the Fourth Ward.",

Parking is also a little tricky. You go slightly past the coffee shop and turn right at the mechanic/body shop. There's free parking in that large parking lot on the right, despite the parking signs threatening to be towed (confirmed by the employee at Native Coffee). Once you walk in, there's a beautiful patio and inside you'll find a clean, small coffee shop that looks newly renovated. The worker was great and I think I might have spotted the owner in the back working on sandwiches. They have a great menu but went basic and got my usual ice vanilla latte. There's roughly 15 tables and plenty of space when I visited. Only downside is that there were only a few outlets I could spot, but not an issue while I was there. Looked like they had a lot of customers from the neighborhood and a few from the car shop.\n\nDefinitely check it out!",
