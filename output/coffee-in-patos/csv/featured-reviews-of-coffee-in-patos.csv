The coffee is outstanding. The service is small town Arkansas friendly. It is an attractive, relaxing environment to waste a morning in and enjoy some of the best coffee you will ever have. My wife is an expert and coffee epicurean (aka Coffee Snob.) She rated her coffee drink this morning as ""better than I can make at home."" That means it is damn good. Me, no coffee expert, but I enjoyed my cup too. She went with an iced hazel nut latte. It was perfectly balanced. The coffee was not overwhelmed by the hazel nut flavoring, nor too sweet. I had already had two cups of coffee this morning. I didn't need more caffeine. I ordered a decaf mocha with a twist.   I asked for non-fat milk and no whipped cream.

Vanilla Bourbon infused coffee was simply splendid!",Daisy Dawn,4,"Quaint lil place in Paris Kentucky! Expanding the dining area out a few feet could be beneficial and less cramped for guests.
Food was good and server was kind. We really liked how everyone pitched in and helped each other. This makes everything run ""as smoothly as a well oiled machine."" (As my significant other would say) Great job ya'll!

ChIJUY8Sp9O8e4gRDtOBK1-nG2M,Jack's Java Urban Cafe,"Jack's Java in Paris, TN has become a cherished regular spot for our coffee cravings. The coffee always hits the spot, consistently delivering a delicious and satisfying experience. However, it was a recent visit with my daughters that truly highlighted the exceptional kindness and thoughtfulness of the staff.

My daughters walked down to Jack's Java to enjoy a smoothie and a chocolate milk. To my surprise, my youngest daughter ran back with sheer excitement, sharing a heartwarming story. She recounted how the lady behind the counter, without even being asked, kindly offered her a glass of water alongside her chocolate milk. The lady's explanation melted my heart: ""I always need some water after I finish my chocolate milk."" It's the little things that can make the biggest differences in life.

This small act of genuine care and consideration made my daughters' day, and it warms my heart to know that Jack's Java goes above and beyond to make their customers feel valued and appreciated. The kindness extended towards my girls truly made a lasting impression.

Beyond their exceptional customer service, Jack's Java continues to impress with their tasty treats and inviting atmosphere. It's a place where you can not only satisfy your coffee cravings but also feel the warmth of a welcoming community.

The service is all done by you, at the cafeteria reception on a screen where you choose the products yourself, enter your name, decide whether you are going to consume or take away (detail that this cafe has a grab and go format - with few tables to consume on site, but it is possible to consume there).
